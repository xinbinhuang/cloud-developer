## 1. Microservices Design Principles and Best Practices

- Draw **Dependency Graph** to list out dependencies, and then determine the best component for refactoring based on complexity and coupling.
- **Strangler Pattern**: gradually refactor a monolith application component by component.

| Term               | Definition                                                                                                             |

## 3. Automating the application development cycle

- Code Deployment involves external dependencies: 
  - infrastructure changes (i.e. database)
  - security changes
  - permissions provisioning
  - load testing
- `CI/CD`: streamlining the process

## 4. K8S

### AWS Container ecosystem

Three main container orchestraion players in the market before K8S dominance: `Docker Swarm`, `ECS`, `K8S`

- `ECS`: AWS own solution for container orchestration
- `EKS`: Managed K8S
- `Fargate`: AWS tool that helps streamline deploying containers to ECS and EKS.

### Debugging

- `kubectl exec -it <pod_name> bash`
- `kubectl logs <pod_name>`

## 5. Best Practices/Design Patterns for K8S in production

### Config

- `Cost`
  - Configure the resources and replicas for our deployed applications.
- `Security`
  - Configure who has access to the Kubernetes pods and services.
  - Secure traffic for least-privilege

### Production ready

- `Restrict Access`
  - Follow properties of least-privilege to secure our application.
- `Scale`
  - Be able to handle the number and size of user requests.
- `Availability`
  - Ensure that the application is responsive and able to be used when needed.

### Reverse Proxy

Act as an API Gateway: [Building Microservices: Using an API Gateway](https://www.nginx.com/blog/building-microservices-using-an-api-gateway/)

- simplify service management to have a single point of entry

### Securing Microservices

Use `Penetration testing` to test security.

- `AWS security groups`: Enables you to restrict the inbound and outbound traffic for AWS resources.
- `kubernetes Ingress and Egress`: Enables you to restrict the inbound and outbound traffic for Kubernetes resources.

### Scaling and Self-healing

#### Self-healing

Ref: [Kubernetes Health Check Best Practices](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/kubernetes-best-practices-setting-up-health-checks-with-readiness-and-liveness-probes)

- `Health checks`
  - an HTTP endpoint that must return a 200 response for a healthy status. Kubernetes will periodically ping this endpoint.
- `Replicas`
  - Kubernetes will attempt to maintain the number of desired replicas. If a pod is terminated, it will automatically recreate the pod.

#### Horizontal Pod Autoscaler

- `kubectl autoscale deployment <NAME> --cpu-percent=<CPU_PERCENTAGE>                --min=<MIN_REPLICAS> --max=<MAX_REPLICAS>` 
- `kubectl get hpa`

### Logging

Best practices

- `timestamp`
- `consistent format`
- `PID` to track activity
- `Log rotations`
- `Stack traces`
- `Log timestamp delta`: measure performance

| Resilience                      | The property of an application to handle and recover from failures.                                                                                  |
